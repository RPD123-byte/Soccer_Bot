# Soccer Player Database Query Agent

## Overview

This repository contains an advanced agentic framework designed to convert natural language questions into structured queries for searching a database of soccer players. The system leverages a custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution that transforms natural language queries into well-defined JSON search criteria, retrieves the relevant information from a database, and then generates natural language responses based on the retrieved data. 

The agent is optimized to minimize redundant searches by utilizing memory of previous interactions, ensuring that it only performs new queries when necessary. This capability allows the chatbot to provide accurate, context-aware responses while efficiently managing the information it processes.

## Key Features

### 1. Natural Language to Structured Query Conversion
The core functionality of this agent involves converting natural language queries into strictly formatted JSON search criteria. This transformation allows the agent to interact effectively with the soccer player database, retrieving precise and relevant information.

### 2. Custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
The system employs a custom RAG approach, combining information retrieval with generative AI to craft detailed and accurate responses. The retrieval component uses a bespoke search algorithm to ensure that the most relevant data is retrieved from the database before the generative model formulates a response.

### 3. Memory and Context Awareness
The chatbot is equipped with a memory mechanism that retains past responses and queries. This feature allows the agent to avoid redundant searches by recalling previously retrieved information. When a user asks a follow-up question or a related query, the agent can utilize its memory to refine the search criteria, reducing unnecessary database queries and enhancing response coherence.

### 4. Custom Search Algorithm
The agent uses a custom search algorithm tailored specifically for the soccer player database. This algorithm is designed to handle complex queries, optimize search efficiency, and ensure that the most relevant results are retrieved based on the JSON criteria generated from the natural language input.

### 5. Contextual Query Refinement
The agent is capable of refining queries based on the context provided by the user. If the same or similar information has been retrieved in a previous interaction, the agent intelligently narrows down the search criteria or directly uses the information in memory, providing faster and more contextually relevant responses.

### 6. Scalability and Flexibility
This framework is designed to be scalable and adaptable to various data environments. While currently tailored for a soccer player database, the underlying architecture can be modified to handle other types of databases or knowledge domains with minimal adjustments.

## System Workflow

1. **User Input**: The user asks a question in natural language, such as "Who has the most goals in the Premier League this season?"

2. **Query Conversion**: The agent parses the natural language question and converts it into a structured JSON search query that the database can understand. For example:

   ```json
   {
       "league": "Premier League",
       "season": "2023/2024",
       "statistic": "goals",
       "sort": "desc",
       "limit": 1
   }
   ```

3. **Database Retrieval**: The custom search algorithm executes the JSON query against the soccer player database, retrieving the relevant data.

4. **Memory Check**: Before generating a response, the agent checks its memory to determine if similar information has already been retrieved and can be reused.

5. **Response Generation**: Using the retrieved data, the generative AI component formulates a natural language response, such as "The top goal scorer in the Premier League this season is Harry Kane with 25 goals."

6. **Context-Aware Follow-up**: If the user asks a related follow-up question, the agent refines its query based on the existing data in memory, avoiding redundant searches and improving response time.

7. **Memory Update**: The agent updates its memory with the new information, ensuring that it can provide contextually relevant responses in future interactions.

## Applications

- **Sports Analytics**: This agent can be used by sports analysts, journalists, and enthusiasts to quickly retrieve and analyze data about soccer players and teams.
- **Interactive Fan Engagement**: Soccer clubs or sports media platforms can deploy this chatbot to engage fans with interactive Q&A sessions about players and matches.
- **Research and Data Exploration**: Researchers can use the agent to explore large datasets, asking complex queries that require detailed, multi-step reasoning.

## Future Enhancements

- **Expanded Knowledge Base**: Integrate additional data sources, such as match reports, player biographies, and historical statistics, to provide even richer responses.
- **Advanced Natural Language Understanding**: Improve the agent's ability to handle more complex and nuanced queries, including ambiguous or multi-part questions.
- **Enhanced Memory Capabilities**: Develop a more sophisticated memory system that can manage long-term context across multiple sessions, providing even more seamless interactions.

## Conclusion

This project represents a powerful tool for transforming natural language queries into actionable insights within the domain of soccer analytics. By combining custom search algorithms, a RAG framework, and memory-based optimization, the agent provides accurate, contextually aware responses that are both informative and efficient. Whether used in professional sports analytics or fan engagement, this agent offers a robust solution for interacting with complex datasets through natural language.
